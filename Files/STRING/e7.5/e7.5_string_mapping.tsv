915	ENSMUSG00000020057	10090.ENSMUSP00000020249	Dram1	DNA damage-regulated autophagy modulator protein 1; Lysosomal modulator of autophagy that plays a central role in p53/TP53-mediated apoptosis. Not involved in p73/TP73- mediated autophagy (By similarity)
916	ENSMUSG00000028232	10090.ENSMUSP00000029891	Tmem68	Transmembrane protein 68
917	ENSMUSG00000035311	10090.ENSMUSP00000020251	Gnptab	N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase subunits alpha/beta; Catalyzes the formation of mannose 6-phosphate (M6P) markers on high mannose type oligosaccharides in the Golgi apparatus. M6P residues are required to bind to the M6P receptors (MPR), which mediate the vesicular transport of lysosomal enzymes to the endosomal/prelysosomal compartment; Belongs to the stealth family
918	ENSMUSG00000018983	10090.ENSMUSP00000050047	E2f2	Transcription factor E2F2; Transcription activator that binds DNA cooperatively with DP proteins through the E2 recognition site, 5'-TTTC[CG]CGC- 3' found in the promoter region of a number of genes whose products are involved in cell cycle regulation or in DNA replication. The DRTF1/E2F complex functions in the control of cell-cycle progression from g1 to s phase. E2F2 binds specifically to RB1 in a cell-cycle dependent manner
919	ENSMUSG00000042292	10090.ENSMUSP00000105207	Mkl1	MKL/myocardin-like protein 1; Transcriptional coactivator of serum response factor (SRF) with the potential to modulate SRF target genes. Suppresses TNF-induced cell death by inhibiting activation of caspases; its transcriptional activity is indispensable for the antiapoptotic function. It may up-regulate antiapoptotic molecules, which in turn inhibit caspase activation
920	ENSMUSG00000042842	10090.ENSMUSP00000105922	Serpinb6b	Serine (or cysteine) peptidase inhibitor, clade B, member 6b; Belongs to the serpin family
921	ENSMUSG00000020921	10090.ENSMUSP00000021296	Tmem101	Transmembrane protein 101; May activate NF-kappa-B signaling pathways
922	ENSMUSG00000025511	10090.ENSMUSP00000026585	Tspan4	Tetraspanin-4; Tetraspanin 4; Belongs to the tetraspanin (TM4SF) family
